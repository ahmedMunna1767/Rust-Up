// Tony Hoare, the inventor of null, has this to say
// I call it my billion-dollar mistake. At that time,
// I was designing the first comprehensive type system
// for references in an object-oriented language.
// My goal was to ensure that all use of references
// should be absolutely safe, with checking performed
// automatically by the compiler. But I couldnâ€™t resist
// the temptation to put in a null reference,
// simply because it was so easy to implement.
// This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities,
// and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion
// dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.
